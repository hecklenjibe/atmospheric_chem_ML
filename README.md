A virtual environment was used to manage any modules added. To use this repo use the following commands:
'''
$ python3 -m venv venv # Creates a virtual environment
$ source venv/bin/activate # Activates virtual environment
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt # Download requirements
